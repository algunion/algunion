## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My programming journey began during my medical studies, where I discovered a lasting interest in **genetic programming** and the broader question of how complex systems can be built, tested, and understood. That interest has carried me through years of work at the boundary of the biomedical and computer science fields.

I keep a **tinkering mode of practice**: contracting, taking on challenging projects, experimenting with ideas, and collaborating with startups. Much of my work is shaped by a **Popperian philosophy**.

### Focus
- Large language models, agent-based modeling, and genetic programming  
- Context-aware agent architectures for adaptive problem-solving  
- Biomedical text mining, knowledge graphs, and AI-driven curation systems
